# Desserts App

Demo app in Flutter using ListView and Dialog.

## Building

You can follow these instructions to build the app
and install it onto your device.

- Go to the images directory in the File Explorer.
- Open command prompt and type the following command:
  python -m SimpleHTTPServer
- Once the command runs successfully, test the link in the browser
  For example, if you are running the app on emulator, type in localhost:8000/
  OR
  if you are using your own device(I connected my device over network), type in <IP address>:8000/
- If you can see the directory structure in the browser, then you are good to go!
- Use the same link for accessing the images in the code.

### Prerequisites

If you are new to Flutter, please follow
the [Flutter Setup](https://flutter.io/setup/) guide.
